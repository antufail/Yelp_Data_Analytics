Project Idea: Analyzing Restaurant Health Inspection Data and Yelp Ratings in College Park and
Surrounding Areas

Theme: The relationship between restaurant health inspection scores and Yelp ratings in College
Park and surrounding areas

Objective: The goal of this project is to analyze the relationship between health inspection scores
of restaurants and their Yelp ratings. This will help to understand whether customers' perceptions
of restaurant quality align with their actual health standards. The project will aim to answer
questions such as:

1. Is there a correlation between health inspection scores and Yelp ratings?
2. Are certain types of cuisine more likely to have lower health inspection scores?
3. Are there specific factors from the health inspections that significantly impact Yelp
ratings?

Data Sources:
1. Restaurant health inspection data, including scores and specific violations, from local
health departments or government websites.
   a. Visit the websites of local health departments or government agencies responsible
    for restaurant health inspections in College Park and the surrounding areas. They
    often provide inspection records and data.
   b. Alternatively, you may find health inspection datasets on open data portals, such
    as Data.gov, OpenDataSoft, or state-specific open data websites.

2. Yelp data on restaurant ratings, reviews, and other relevant information, which can be
obtained using the Yelp API.
  a. Yelp Data: Yelp provides an API (Yelp Fusion API) that allows you to access
    business details, ratings, reviews, and other relevant information. To use the Yelp
    API, you will need to create a Yelp account, apply for an API key, and follow the
    documentation on how to make API requests. You can access the Yelp API
    documentation and apply for an API key at https://www.yelp.com/developers.

Data Manipulation Techniques:
  1. Merge the health inspection data with the Yelp data based on restaurant names and
    addresses.
  2. Clean the data by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and ensuring
    consistency in units and scales.
  3. Calculate average Yelp ratings and health inspection scores for each restaurant and
    cuisine type.

Analysis and Visualization:
1. Conduct a correlation analysis to investigate the relationship between health inspection
scores and Yelp ratings.
2. Perform a regression analysis to identify the impact of specific health inspection factors
(e.g., cleanliness, food handling practices) on Yelp ratings.
3. Create visualizations such as bar graphs, box plots, and scatter plots to illustrate the
findings
